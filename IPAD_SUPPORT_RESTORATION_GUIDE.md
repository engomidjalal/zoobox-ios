# iPad Support Restoration Guide

## Overview
This app was temporarily configured to **iPhone-only** for App Store approval due to iPad splash screen issues. All iPad optimization code has been preserved and can be easily re-enabled.

## What Was Changed for iPhone-Only Release

### 1. Project Configuration (`project.pbxproj`)
- Changed `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` from `"1,2"` to `"1"` in all build configurations
- Commented out `INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPad` settings

### 2. iPad-Specific Code (Preserved)
The following files contain iPad optimizations that are still intact:
- `Extensions/UIDevice+Zoobox.swift` - Device-specific configurations
- `Managers/UserExperienceManager.swift` - iPad-specific UI adjustments  
- `ViewControllers/MainViewController.swift` - iPad layout optimizations
- All documentation files starting with "IPAD_"

## How to Re-enable iPad Support

### Step 1: Update Project Settings
In `Zoobox.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:

1. Change `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1";` back to `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2";` in all configurations
2. Uncomment the iPad interface orientation lines:
   ```
   // Remove comment from:
   // INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPad = "UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight";
   ```

### Step 2: Test iPad Functionality
1. Test the splash screen on iPad (this was the original issue)
2. Verify all iPad-specific UI optimizations work correctly
3. Test orientation changes on iPad
4. Verify all permissions work correctly on iPad

### Step 3: Update App Store Connect
1. Enable iPad deployment target in App Store Connect
2. Add iPad screenshots if required
3. Update app description to mention iPad support

## iPad-Specific Issues to Watch For

### Splash Screen Issue (Original Problem)
The app was getting stuck on the splash screen on iPad. Check:
- Video playback in `SplashViewController.swift`
- Ensure `proceedToConnectivityCheck()` is called properly
- Test on actual iPad devices, not just simulator

### Interface Orientations
iPad supports more orientations than iPhone:
- Portrait and Portrait Upside Down
- Landscape Left and Landscape Right

### Layout Optimizations
The app includes iPad-specific layout optimizations:
- Larger screens considerations
- Different aspect ratios
- iPad-specific UI elements

## Testing Checklist for iPad Re-enablement

- [ ] App launches successfully on iPad
- [ ] Splash screen plays and transitions correctly
- [ ] All permissions work (Location, Camera, Notifications)
- [ ] WebView loads and functions properly
- [ ] All orientations work correctly
- [ ] UI elements are properly sized for iPad
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on iPad
- [ ] App doesn't crash on iPad-specific actions

## Notes
- All iPad optimization code is preserved and ready for re-enablement
- The only changes made were to temporarily disable iPad targeting
- No functionality was removed, only device targeting was restricted
