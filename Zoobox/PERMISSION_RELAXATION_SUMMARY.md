## Apple Guidelines Compliance

The changes align with Apple's guidelines:

- **Clear messaging**: Users understand why permissions are requested
- **No blocking**: App doesn't prevent use without permissions
- **Graceful handling**: App works with limited functionality when permissions are denied

## Testing Recommendations

1. **First-time users**: Verify they can skip all permissions and use the app
2. **Permission flows**: Test that permission requests work when users choose to enable them
3. **Denied permissions**: Ensure app continues to work when permissions are denied
4. **Settings access**: Verify "Open Settings" option works correctly
5. **WebView integration**: Test that web content handles missing permissions gracefully
6. **Cookie tracking**: Test permission cookies are created and updated in real-time
7. **Settings detection**: Verify permission changes in Settings are detected when returning to app
8. **Console logging**: Check for detailed üç™ emoji logs during permission operations

## Future Considerations

- **Feature discovery**: Consider adding in-app prompts to explain benefits of permissions
- **Settings integration**: Add easy access to app settings for permission management
- **Analytics**: Track permission grant rates to understand user preferences
- **Contextual requests**: Request permissions when users actually try to use related features
