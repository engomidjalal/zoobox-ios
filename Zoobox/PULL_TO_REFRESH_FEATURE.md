# Pull-to-Refresh Feature Documentation

## Overview
A modern, iOS 17+ compatible pull-to-refresh feature has been added to the Zoobox webview. This feature provides users with an intuitive way to refresh the web content with visual feedback and haptic responses.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Pull to refresh**: Users can pull down on the webview to trigger a refresh
- **Visual feedback**: Modern refresh control with animated spinner
- **Haptic feedback**: Tactile response when refresh is triggered and completed
- **State management**: Different visual states for loading, success, and error

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements
- **Dynamic titles**: Refresh control shows different messages based on state:
  - "Pull to refresh" (default)
  - "Refreshing..." (during refresh)
  - "Refreshed successfully" (on success)
  - "Refresh failed" (on error)
  - "No internet connection" (when offline)

- **Color coding**:
  - Blue: Default state
  - Green: Success
  - Red: Error
  - Orange: No internet connection

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- Uses `UIScrollView` wrapper around `WKWebView`
- Implements `UIRefreshControl` for modern refresh behavior
- Integrates with existing connectivity and error handling systems

#### Key Components
1. **ScrollView Setup**: Wraps the webview in a scroll view to enable pull-to-refresh
2. **Refresh Control**: Modern `UIRefreshControl` with custom styling
3. **State Management**: Handles different refresh states and visual feedback
4. **Connectivity Integration**: Updates refresh control based on internet connectivity

#### Methods Added
- `setupScrollViewWithRefreshControl()`: Initializes the scroll view and refresh control
- `handleRefresh()`: Handles refresh action with haptic feedback
- `showRefreshSuccess()`: Shows success state with green color
- `showRefreshError()`: Shows error state with red color
- `updateRefreshControlForConnectivity()`: Updates refresh control based on connectivity
- `triggerRefresh()`: Programmatically triggers refresh

### ðŸ”„ Integration with Existing Systems

#### Connectivity Manager
- Refresh control is disabled when no internet connection is available
- Shows "No internet connection" message when offline
- Automatically re-enables when connection is restored

#### Error Handling
- Refresh control stops and shows error state when page load fails
- Integrates with existing error handling system
- Provides appropriate feedback for different error types

#### Haptic Feedback
- Light impact when refresh completes successfully
- Medium impact when refresh is triggered
- Heavy impact when refresh fails

### ðŸ“± iOS Compatibility
- **iOS 17+**: Uses latest `UIRefreshControl` features including `preferredDisplayMode`
- **Backward compatibility**: Works on earlier iOS versions with graceful degradation
- **Modern styling**: Follows latest iOS design guidelines

### ðŸŽ¯ User Experience
1. **Intuitive**: Standard pull-to-refresh gesture that users expect
2. **Responsive**: Immediate visual and haptic feedback
3. **Informative**: Clear status messages for all states
4. **Accessible**: Works with VoiceOver and other accessibility features

## Usage

### For Users
Simply pull down on the webview to refresh the content. The refresh control will show the current status and provide haptic feedback.

### For Developers
The refresh functionality is automatically integrated into the `MainViewController`. No additional setup is required.

To programmatically trigger a refresh:
```swift
mainViewController.triggerRefresh()
```

## Future Enhancements
- Custom refresh animations
- Pull-to-refresh sensitivity adjustment
- Refresh history tracking
- Offline content refresh support
